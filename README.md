# deliveryApp

I have created a delivery app in Java that acts as a pizza delivery service to some cities in South Africa.

This was for a task in my HyperionDev Full Stack Web and Software Engineering Bootcamp.

I have changed 2 variable names as these were not descriptive enough.

driverLocation - This had to be changed to locationOfDriver as this is more clear and descriptive pricePerPizza - This had to be changed to pizzaOrdered because this is more clear for the user to read or other code reviewers to understand

I will commit these changes here.
