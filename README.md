# deliveryApp

I have changed 2 variable names as these were not descriptive enough.

driverLocation - This had to be changed to locationOfDriver as this is more clear and descriptive 
pricePerPizza - This had to be changed to pizzaOrdered because this is more clear for the user to read or other code reviewers to understand
  
I will commit these changes here.
